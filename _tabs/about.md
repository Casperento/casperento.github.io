My name is Rafael Eckstein (a.k.a Casperento), and i'm a senior Computer Science student from Brazil.

I'm a programmer that usually works with C++/C#/Python/Shell Script/Java. The main objective of this blog is for me to publish some insights about my daily tasks and other stuff. And to showcase my portfolio too.

Currently, i have some public projects for the Arma 3 modding community, such as 
[A3 Color Converter](https://github.com/Casperento/a3-color-converter) and [CXP SCRIPTS sources](https://github.com/Casperento/cxp-scripts-sources).
