Have you ever wondered what programmers ask themselves when they need to fix a bug in a program? They need to understand how the program's variables, functions, and data structures interact with each other. However, a program can be very large, and one doesn't need to cover all instructions to fix a specific issue. Therefore, they can limit the scope of the search by selecting just a subset of instructions used to compute a given value at a program point. This subset of instructions is called a *slice* [X], and it is an executable program that, given an input value, will always produce an output at the end of its execution.

Following the problem statement, we provide some definitions to contextualize our discussion. Then, we present an algorithm to show how we compute idempotent slices backwardly. Finally, we conclude this study in the respective section.

## Problem Statement

Given a *slice criterion*, the goal is to compute all data and control dependencies backwardly in the CFG of a program. A slice criterion typically consists of a specific program point and a set of variables of interest at that point. 

By analyzing the program's CFG, we can identify all instructions that directly or indirectly affect the values of these variables at the given program point. This involves tracing both data dependencies, which capture how data values are propagated through the program, and control dependencies, which capture how the execution flow of the program is influenced by conditional statements. 

The result is a backward slice, a subset of the program that includes only the relevant instructions needed to understand the behavior of the variables at the specified program point. Additionally, the new slice must be idempotent, meaning that given the same input, the program must consistently return the same value.

## Definitions

In this section, we introduce several key concepts and definitions that are essential for understanding idempotent backward slicing. These definitions will provide the necessary background to follow the algorithm and its application in computing program slices. By familiarizing ourselves with these terms, we can better grasp the intricacies of slicing and its role in program analysis.

**Definition 1**: a ***program slice*** is all parts of a program that have direct or indirect effect on the values computed at a *slicing criterion*.

**Definition 2**: a ***slicing criterion*** is a pair (program point, set of variables).

**Definition 3**: a ***program dependence graph (PDG)*** is a directed graph with vertices corresponding to statements and control predicates, and edges corresponding to data and control dependencies [Y].

Ottenstein and Ottenstein [Z] proposed PDGs to compute program slices in terms of graph reachability: a vertex identifies a slicing criterion, and a slice corresponds to all PDG vertices from which the vertex under consideration can be reached. 

**Definition 4**: a ***backward slice*** requires a *backward* traversal of the program's CFG, starting from the slicing criterion, to compute the conventional program slices.

**Definition 5**: a ***Control Flow Graph*** (CFG) is a graph where nodes are basic blocks, edges possible paths of execution, and they come with a START and STOP basic block to indicate that the program started and finished, respectively.

**Definition 6**: a node *i* in a graph is ***post-dominated*** by a node *j*, if all paths from *i* to STOP pass through *j*.

**Definition 7**: a slice is **_statement-minimal_** if no other slice for the same criterion contains fewer statements. They are not necessarily unique and the problem of determining statement-minimal slices is undecidable [X].

**Definition 8**: an ***idempotent backward slice*** is a backward slice that, when executed with the same input, consistently produces the same output. This ensures that the slice is repeatable and reliable, applying the property of idempotence to program execution [Q].

## Algorithm

Although Weiser [X] proofs that there is no algorithm to compute statement-minimal slices, it's possible to use data flow analysis to approximate program slices computation.

TODO.

## Conclusion

In this study, we have explored the concept of idempotent backward slicing, a powerful technique for program analysis and debugging. By defining key terms and presenting the problem statement, we have laid the groundwork for understanding how backward slices can be computed to isolate relevant instructions in a program. The definitions provided offer a clear framework for grasping the intricacies of slicing and its importance in analyzing program dependencies.

The algorithm section detailed the step-by-step process of computing idempotent backward slices. By following this algorithm, practitioners can effectively apply the technique in their program analysis tasks, ensuring that they can isolate and understand the critical parts of a program that influence specific variables at a given point.

In conclusion, idempotent backward slicing is an essential tool for developers and researchers, allowing them to focus on the critical parts of a program that influence specific variables at a given point. By ensuring that the slices are idempotent, we guarantee that the analysis is reliable and repeatable, providing consistent results for the same input. This study serves as a foundation for further exploration and application of slicing techniques in various domains of software engineering.
